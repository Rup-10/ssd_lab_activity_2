Q1) Middle text of a text file:

We have used awk command here to find out number of lines in our text file. Then we have divided that number by 2 and got a number in the form of i=n/2(for even) or i=(n+1)/2(for odd). Then we have simply printed the ith line.

Q2) Names of all the shell that belongs to user:

We have used command line argument here. When the user provides a valid password, all the required shell are shown.
